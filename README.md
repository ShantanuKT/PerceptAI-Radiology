# 🚀 PerceptAI Demo Notebook

Welcome to the **PerceptAI** 🌐 interactive demo — an all-in-one Jupyter notebook that sets up a full-stack AI application with just a few clicks. From downloading a password-protected source 🔐 to spinning up a public frontend & backend via ngrok 🚇 — this notebook does it all.

> ✨ **No complex setup. Just run the cells and go live.**

---

## 📌 What's Inside?

🧠 **PerceptAI** blends the power of  
- 🐍 Python (FastAPI backend)  
- ⚛️ React (frontend)  
- 🔐 Password-protected ZIP handling  
- 🌍 Public URLs via `ngrok`  
- 🔧 Auto-install of system + project dependencies  
- 📦 One-click launch of your local demo to the world

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

✅ Python 3.8+  
✅ Node.js (v18 or newer)  
✅ `curl`, `unzip`, and `gdown`  
✅ Works on local machines **or Google Colab**

## 🌍 Public Access with Ngrok

A public URL is generated on-the-fly:
🔗 `https://<random-id>.ngrok.io`

Use it to:

* 📱 Share live demos
* 🌎 Test on mobile
* 🧪 Collaborate in real-time

Just make sure to set your `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` in the `.env` file.

---

## 🧪 Environment Setup

Copy example config:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Update:

```env
API_KEY=your_api_key
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_token
PORT=8000
```

---

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

Here’s what happens step-by-step:

1. 🔒 Download & extract the secure ZIP
2. 🐍 Install FastAPI, `python-dotenv`, `pyngrok`, etc.
3. ⚛️ Set up frontend with `npm install`
4. 🧵 Spin up servers (React + FastAPI)
5. 🌍 Serve app via ngrok

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

* Ngrok not found? Install it via pip: `pip install pyngrok`
* Port conflict? Try changing the backend `PORT` in `.env`
* Colab issue? Check runtime permissions or use local Jupyter
